    <!-- Challenge 1: Change the title of the page to Web Technologies -->
    <title> Web Technologies </title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- Challenge 2: Create a heading, h1 for Web Technologies -->
      <h1> Web Technologies </h1>
    
    <!-- Challenge 3: Create a heading, h3 for HTML -->
      <h3> HTML </h3>
    <!-- Challenge 4: Create a paragraph explaining what is HTML. At least 3 sentences. -->
      <p> HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the foundational language for creating web pages and defining their structure. It is not a programming language but a markup language that uses a system of tags and attributes to organize and present content within a web browser. </p>
    <!-- Challenge 4a: Insert a horizontal rule, hr -->
      <hr>
    
    <!-- Challenge 5: Create a heading, h3 for CSS -->
      <h3> CSS </h3>
    <!-- Challenge 6: Create a paragraph explaining what is CSS.  At least 3 sentences. -->
      <p> CSS, which stands for Cascading Style Sheets, is a styling language used to describe the presentation of a document written in a markup language, most commonly HTML. It defines how HTML elements are to be displayed on various media, such as screens, paper, or other devices.</p>

    <!-- Challenge 7: Create a heading, h3 for JavaScript -->
      <h3> JavaScript </h3>
    <!-- Challenge 8: Create a paragraph explaining what is JavaScript.  At least 3 sentences. -->
      <p> JavaScript is a high-level, multi-paradigm programming language primarily known for enabling interactive and dynamic content on websites. It is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML (which provides structure) and CSS (which provides styling).</p>
    <!-- Challenge 8a: Insert a horizontal rule, hr -->
      <hr>
    
    <!-- Challenge Bonus: Similar to the concepts above add one more web technology using a heading and paragraph.  Here are some suggestions of concepts: JQuery, Bootstrap, AFrame -->

<h3> Ruby </h3>
<p> Ruby is an object-oriented, open-source programming language known for its elegant and readable syntax, making it easy for developers to write and understand code quickly. It is commonly used to build dynamic, full-stack web applications, especially when paired with the popular Ruby on Rails framework, which simplifies the development process by providing a structured approach and pre-built tools for tasks like database management and rendering HTML. </p>
